#Neil Shah: DATA 607 HW1

## Introduction:

This assignment is to test our our R transofmation/dataframe skills by playing around with data! I chose the [We Watched 906 Foul Balls To Find Out Where The Most Dangerous Ones Land](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-watched-906-foul-balls-to-find-out-where-the-most-dangerous-ones-land/), data set that covers foul balls. 

The full data set is available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/foul-balls)


## Loading data set 

First I loaded the data into new dataframe

```
  df <- read.csv('foul-balls.csv')

```
## Exploratory Data Analysis 

Now some basic exploration

```
r in df.head() : could not find function "df.head"

```


This data set is a 906 X 7 matrix with 906 variables and 7 variables.  <br>
Matchup: categorical variable <br>
Game-date: date-time varable (numeric) <br>
type of hit: categorical <br>
Exit velocity: continuous numerical variable <br>
Predicted Zone: categorical variable <br>
Camera Zone: categorical variable <br>
Used zone: categorical variable <br>

## Renaming Columns 

So first I'll rename game_date and exit_velocity just to make things a bit simpler

```
 names(df)[names(df) == "game_date"] <- "date"
> names(df)[names(df) == "exit_velocity"] <- "speed"
> names(df)
[1] "誰..matchup"     "date"           "type_of_hit"    "speed"          "predicted_zone" "camera_zone"   
[7] "used_zone"     

```


## Cleaning NA values

So I think it'd be interesting to see which type_of_hit has the fastest speed! However looking at the speed columns...

```
> head(df$speed)
[1]   NA   NA 56.9 78.8   NA   NA
```

It looks like we habe some NA values, that's no good. Let's cleanup and drop them. 

```

> df$speed

```


Ok so much better--Looks like we eliminated almost half the data!




## Speed statistics 

First let's aggregate by simple geometric mean

```
> summarise(group_by(df, type_of_hit), mean(speed))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  type_of_hit      `mean(speed)`
  <fct>                    <dbl>
1 Batter hits self          69.4
2 Fly                       81.6
3 Ground                    75.5
4 Line                      82.1
5 Pop Up                    77.9

```

Interesting--so line hits and fly hits have a very similar speed, following by pop-up, ground and then batter hits self (which I have no clue what that is).

What about the median?

```
> summarise(group_by(df, type_of_hit), median(speed))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  type_of_hit      `median(speed)`
  <fct>                      <dbl>
1 Batter hits self            68.3
2 Fly                         79.1
3 Ground                      74.8
4 Line                        82.6
5 Pop Up                      77.5

```
Ok now we have some separation and this shows the true divide between the Line (the fastest it seems) and the other tyoe of hits.

What about max?

```

summarise(group_by(df, type_of_hit), max(speed))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  type_of_hit      `max(speed)`
  <fct>                   <dbl>
1 Batter hits self         82  
2 Fly                     108. 
3 Ground                  107  
4 Line                    111. 
5 Pop Up                   90.7


```
Interesting--so it seems that the Fly/Ground have similar top speeds--but once again the Line is the overall fastest (max speed) wise. Yet from the median data set--Pop Up had a higher median speed than Fly, yet here the Fly has a higher top speed. Very cool! I wonder if we can make a new metric to see what % of max speed possible speed each type of hit is--iike an efficiency?

```

type_of_hit      `mean(speed)/max(speed)`
  <fct>                               <dbl>
1 Batter hits self                    0.846
2 Fly                                 0.752
3 Ground                              0.706
4 Line                                0.742
5 Pop Up                              0.859

```
So at first this seems confusing--since Line has a lower rating but this makes sense due to it's really high top speed. Pop-up's data shows that most pop up hits travel at approximately 86% of it's max speed--this might be due to it being hit off the bat a certain way. Fly and Ground operate near 75% of their max speed.

## A Final Boxplot

Let's put this all together to visualizat the data

![Boxplot](C:\Users\Neil\Documents\MSDS\DATA 607\speedboxplot.png)


## Conclusions 

This was a quick and dirty way to look at a data-set in R, but it shows the power of exploratory data-analysis and grouping functions. 

The main observation were the different stratifications of speeds for the type of hit--particularly Line being the fastest. We can improve on this study by the following analysis

-Plot variation of speed by matches; Maybe there is a team with strong batters?<br>
-See how speed evolved over time--did batters get stronger? <br>
